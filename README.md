# Dotfiles

## Programs whose configs can be found here

+ dwm
+ vim
+ zsh
+ fl
+ ncmpcpp and mpd (my main music player)
+ mpv
+ And many little scripts I use filed in the `~/.local/.bin/` directory

## Dynamic Configuration Files

Store your favorite or high-traffic directories in `~/.config/directories` or your most
important config files in `~/.config/files` with keyboard shortcuts. When you add
things to theses files vimrc will automatically run `shortcuts` which will
dynamically generate shortcuts for these in zsh.


## Credits

All of the idea and organization was from [Luke Smith](https://youtube.com/c/LukeSmithxyz), if you
want to learn more about linux watch his videos!

It started as a fork but as my enviroment is a lot different from his (Now running VoidLinux while
he is in Artlinux), and a lot of decisions and paths he take that i did not like i will now follow
my on path.


## How to install

There still isn't an fast way to install it, but you can mostly look into `.config` folder and
see which programs that it use.
